### Welcome to Souffleur

*Souffleur* is a cross platform remote control for presentations.

I beg your pardon ðŸ¤”

Are you frequently doing presentations, for example during workshops or at meetups and conferences? And have you ever wondered if you really need a physical remote control to flip through slides?

*Souffleur* allows you to use your smartphone, foldable, or tablet instead. Just download and install the Souffleur server on your computer and pair it with the app. You can find more information regarding installation, setup, and usage at https://www.thomaskuenneth.de/souffleur/
