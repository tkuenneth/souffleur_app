### Welcome to Souffleur

*Souffleur* is a cross platform remote control for presentations.

I beg your pardon 🤔

Are you frequently doing presentations, for example during workshops or at meetups and conferences? And have you ever wondered if you really need a physical remote control to flip through slides?

*Souffleur* allows you to use your smartphone, foldable, or tablet instead. Just download and install the Souffleur server app on your computer and pair it with your mobile device. You can find more information regarding installation, setup, and usage at https://www.thomaskuenneth.de/souffleur/install.html

This repository contains the Souffleur mobile app (written in Flutter). The server app is also open source. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/tkuenneth/souffleur_server), too.
